### Project Title:
Analyzing the Impact of 5G Launch on AtliQo's Performance Using Python

### Project Objective:
To analyze and compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of AtliQo before and after the 5G launch in May 2022, providing insights to help the management make informed decisions to recover the active user rate and improve revenue growth.

Background:
AtliQo, one of India's leading telecom providers, launched its 5G plans in May 2022. Following this launch, the company observed a decline in active users and revenue growth. The business director has requested a detailed analysis to understand the impact of the 5G launch on these metrics.

### Tools and Technologies:

Python: For data analysis and visualization
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
Jupyter Notebook: For documenting the analysis process

### Methodology:

Data Collection: Gather data on KPIs for periods before and after the 5G launch.
Data Cleaning: Ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Data Analysis: Use Python to analyze the data, comparing pre and post-5G launch periods.
Visualization: Create visual representations of the data to identify trends and patterns.
Insights Generation: Derive actionable insights from the analysis to inform decision-making.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Active user count
Citywise Revenue
Unsubscribed Users
Average revenue per user (ARPU)

### Expected Insights:

Identification of trends in active users and revenue before and after the 5G launch.
Understanding the factors contributing to the decline in active users and revenue growth.
Recommendations for optimizing internet plans to attract more active users.
Strategic insights to help the management make informed decisions to improve performance metrics.
